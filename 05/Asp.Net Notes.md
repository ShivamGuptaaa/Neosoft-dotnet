## Asp.Net
- ASP.NET is a free web framework for building great websites and web applications using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You can also create Web APIs and use real-time technologies like Web Sockets.
- ASP.NET offers four primary development frameworks:
  1. ASP.NET Web Forms
     - With ASP.NET Web Forms, you can build dynamic websites using a familiar drag-and-drop, event-driven model. 
     - A design surface and hundreds of controls and components let you rapidly build sophisticated, powerful UI-driven sites with data access.
  2. ASP.NET MVC
     - ASP.NET MVC gives you a powerful, patterns-based way to build dynamic websites that enables a clean separation of concerns and that gives you full control over markup for enjoyable, agile development. 
     - ASP.NET MVC includes many features that enable fast, TDD-friendly development for creating sophisticated applications that use the latest web standards.
  3. ASP.NET Web Pages
     - ASP.NET Web Pages and the Razor syntax provide a fast, approachable, and lightweight way to combine server code with HTML to create dynamic web content. 
     - Connect to databases, add video, link to social networking sites, and include many more features that help you create beautiful sites that conform to the latest web standards.
  4. ASP.NET Single Page Application
     - ASP.NET Single Page Application (SPA) helps you build applications that include significant client-side interactions using HTML 5, CSS 3 and JavaScript. 
     - Visual Studio includes a template for building single page applications using knockout.js and ASP.NET Web API.
- In addition to the four main development frameworks, ASP.NET also offers additional technologies
  1. ASP.NET Web API 
     - ASP.NET Web API is a framework that makes it easy to build HTTP services that reach a broad range of clients, including browsers and mobile devices. 
     - ASP.NET Web API is an ideal platform for building RESTful applications on the .NET Framework.
  2. ASP.NET SignalR
     - ASP.NET SignalR is a new library for ASP.NET developers that makes developing real-time web functionality easier. 
     - SignalR allows bi-directional communication between server and client. 
     - Servers can push content to connected clients instantly as it becomes available. 
     - SignalR supports Web Sockets, and falls back to other compatible techniques for older browsers.

## [Asp.Net Web Forms](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/web-forms/)
- The Web Forms framework targets developers who prefer declarative and control-based programming, such as Microsoft Windows Forms (WinForms) and WPF/XAML/Silverlight. 
- It offers a WYSIWYG designer-driven development model, so it's popular with developers looking for a rapid application development (RAD) environment for web development. 
- If you are new to web programming and are familiar with the traditional Microsoft RAD client development tools (for example, for Visual Basic and Visual C#), you can quickly build a web application without having experience in HTML and JavaScript.
- ASP.NET Web Forms are pages that are based on Microsoft ASP.NET technology, in which code that runs on the server dynamically generates Web page output to the browser or client device. 
- An ASP.NET Web Forms page automatically renders the correct browser-compliant HTML for features such as styles, layout, and so on.
